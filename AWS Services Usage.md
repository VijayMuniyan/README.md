# AWS Services Usage

This document lists the AWS services I have worked with and provides brief descriptions of the use cases for each service.

## List of AWS Services

### 1. **IAM (Identity and Access Management)**
   - **Use Case**: "Used **IAM** to configure user roles and permissions, ensuring secure access to AWS resources by enforcing the principle of least privilege."

### 2. **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**
   - **Use Case**: "Used **EC2** instances to host web applications, configure auto-scaling for high availability, and manage virtual machines in the cloud."

### 3. **S3 (Simple Storage Service)**
   - **Use Case**: "Used **S3** to store application logs, backup files, and large datasets, and integrated it with AWS Lambda for log processing."

### 4. **ELB (Elastic Load Balancer)**
   - **Use Case**: "Implemented **ELB** to distribute incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances for high availability, enabling seamless scaling of applications."

### 5. **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**
   - **Use Case**: "Created a custom **VPC** to isolate resources in private and public subnets for secure communication, and set up routing tables and security groups for network security."

### 6. **Route 53 (DNS Service)**
   - **Use Case**: "Configured **Route 53** to manage DNS records and route traffic to different regions, ensuring high availability of web applications."

### 7. **SNS (Simple Notification Service)**
   - **Use Case**: "Used **SNS** to send notifications for EC2 instance health, security alerts, and system events to administrators via email and SMS."

### 8. **Splunk (Third-party Integration)**
   - **Use Case**: "Integrated **Splunk** with AWS to collect and analyze log data from AWS resources, providing valuable insights for monitoring and troubleshooting."

### 9. **Terraform (Infrastructure as Code)**
   - **Use Case**: "Used **Terraform** for infrastructure automation, defining infrastructure in code and deploying AWS resources such as EC2 instances, VPCs, and RDS databases in a repeatable manner."

### 10. **Route 53 (DNS Management)**
   - **Use Case**: "Configured **Route 53** for routing traffic to multiple availability zones and regions, ensuring high availability and faster response times for users."

## Conclusion

In this guide, I've outlined the AWS services I've worked with and provided examples of their use cases, demonstrating how these services can be used to build scalable, reliable, and secure cloud infrastructures.
